#   hawaii_translation_loader(<dest_var>
#                             TRANSLATIONS_DIR <translations_dir>
#                             CATALOG_NAME <catalog_name>)
#
# Generates C++ code that installs the translation catalog <catalog_name>
# from the <translations_dir> directory for Qt applications and libraries.
# The <translations_dir> path is relative to the generic data location
# returned by QStandardPaths.
#
# The generated code is appended to <sources_var>.
